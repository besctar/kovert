2015-08-31 v0.3.0 release
=========================================================

Moved part of the Vert.x base library to Klutter, makes more sense there for the helper style parts of the library.  This
breaks imports for those functions which are now under `uy.klutter.vertx3`.  Some of the helpers have been improved there.
